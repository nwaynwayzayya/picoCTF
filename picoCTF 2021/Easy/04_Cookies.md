### Commands / Steps:

Step 1: Visit the website.

Step 3: There wasn't much information to find in the 'Elements' tab.

Step 4: We go to 'Network' tab to read the find clues in the headers. 

Step 5: We will try with different cookies. Look at the request headers â€” we will see a Cookie header with a name=value pair.

Step 6: Then, we can go to the 'Application' tab - cookies section. We manually change the cookie value. Refresh the page after each change and watch the response. After several attempts, one of the cookie values will reveal the flag.
