# Insp3c0r

### Objective:

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511

### Commands / Steps:

```bash
# Step 1: We opened the link "http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511" in our browser.

# Step 2: Right click on the screen and click Inspect. 

# Step 3: Go to the sources tab.

# Step 4: The flag is divided as three parts in the three files - index.html, mycss.css, and myjs.js.
```

### Flag:

> picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}

### Notes / Tips

- Always check HTML, CSS, and JS files for hidden information in web challenges.
- DevTools â†’ Sources tab is a common place where flags or hints are hidden.
