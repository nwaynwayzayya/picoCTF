# like1000

### Description:

This .`tar file` got tarred a lot.
Hint: Try and script this, it'll save you a lot of time

### Commands / Steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Download the file.
wget https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_fickle_tempest/8014f84bda2778858cab85943405ae464bd01faed6c0ee344fa8b85c29260ff4/1000.tar

# Step 2: Let's try extracting the tar archive first.
tar -xf 1000.tar
# The outpur from this is another tar archived file, so after trying a few more times, it seems to be a nested tar structure. 

# Step 3: The tar seems to be nested for a thousand times. Extracting the tar archives manually will take a long time. So we will write a bash script to extract this.
# Extract and DELETE immediately
for i in $(seq 1000 -1 1); do
    if [ -f "$i.tar" ]; then
        echo "Extracting $i.tar"
        tar -xf "$i.tar"
        rm "$i.tar"  # Delete after extraction automatically
    fi
done 

# Step 4: Then, we will get a "flag.png" file after the tar extraction loop is over. We will be able to see the flag in the png file.
```

### Notes / Tips

- `seq 1000 -1 1` - generates numbers 1000 down to 1
- `[ -f "$i.tar" ]` - checks if the tar file exists
- `tar -xf "$i.tar"` - extracts the archive
- `rm "$i.tar"` - deletes it to conserve space
