### Description:

What do the `flags` mean?

### Commands / Steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Download the flag file. //Image file attached under the notes section.
wget [filelink]

# Step 2: The image contains some kinds of flags.

# Step 3: First, I thought they might be country flags but it's clearly impossible for some of the flags.

# Step 4: So, I thought it might be some kind of flag codes, so after googling flag codes, I found out that those are "Maritime Signal Codes".

# Step 5: We get the flag if we interpret those flags for alphabets and numbers.
```
